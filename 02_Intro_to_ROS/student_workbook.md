# Introduction to ROS -- Self Study

---

- Use this document to help you study.
- For each item, make a list of questions that you have.  Identify all of the things that don't make sense to you.  Clearly denote these as questions.
- Also, make notes when you have answered a question.  Clearly denote these as things that you now understand.
- In the end, you should have no unanswered questions.

- This document is written in *markdown*.  It's a great language for documentation.  Here's a cheatsheet for you:  https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet

- You will be asked to turn in paper copies of your compiled document.  Please make sure it's neatly formatted.  I suggest using the 
`remarkable` software package that is already installed on your virtual machine.

### Chapter 2 -- Preliminaries

Just read this chapter...**DO NOT INSTALL ANYTHING**. Your virtual machine already has the software loaded and configured for you.  

- Unanswered Questions:
	-Can ROS be done offline
	-What language is roscore
	-What is a CMake macro or custom Python script
	-Why only one Workspace

	-remapping allows named variables to be better labelled and made more specific
	-roslaunch automated launching of collections of ROS nodes
	-TAB auto-completes what is being typed
	-pose tells the x,y,z and orientation
	-tf

	-Topic is stream of messages with a defined type
	-publish sends subscribe receives
	-Messages on same topic must be same data type
	-Ctrl-C stops rostopic and other programs
	-Latched topics allow subscribers to get the last message sent
